# Gossip:

I am working on this project during lockdown to learn some new skills and create a React based messaging web application as my internship this summer got cancelled.

## Goals:
1. Learn best Practices of web development.
3. Learn how to plan an big web application such as:
    * How does technology XXX work?
    * How do I use technology XXX?
    * Why should I use technology XXX over technology YYY?
    * What are the best practices for using technology XXX?
    * What are the currently leading technologies in the ecosystem?
    * What is the effificent way of testing the website.
2. Learn TypeScript, React, Graph QL, Node, Apollo, WebPack

## Milestones:
To not got bored and loose motivation of the project I have set some milestones for myself and the project. I think this will help me to keep motivated to complete the project.
